              Dorian Lynch-Geis is the founder of Copilot Ventures, an advisory
              studio for alternative economy ventures. Copilot grew out of two
              decades spent building practical businesses — and the desire to
              design structures that outlast hype cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a background in socio-cultural anthropology (University of
              Virginia), Dorian has built ventures across the US and Europe,
              including Clipso, Mainstay Materials, Fento, and Selection Sauvage.
              His work spans import/export, technical sales, architectural
              products, and hospitality.
            </p>
            <p>
              He completed the Lift Alternative Economy MBA and holacracy
              training, and serves as founder and treasurer of Roots & Remedies
              Stichting — a nonprofit foundation stewarding regenerative
              projects and shared intellectual property.
